# QTExtended
QTExtended (Quick Tap Extended) is a simple, lightweight Android app with the sole intention of enabling additional functionality through the Google Pixel 6's quick tap settings. 

In its current release (1.0), the two core additions to quick tap functionality include:
- Do not disturb - enabling the quick tap functionality to toggle between do not disturb being enabled/disabled - applies according to a user's do not disturb preferences
- Flashlight - enabling the quick tap functionality to toggle the flashlight on/off

### How to use
To begin using the application, first [download](https://github.com/aidan-nixon/quicktapextended/raw/main/app/release/app-release.apk) and install the APK on your Pixel 6 device. Once installed, long-press the QTExtended app icon, and open "Settings". In the settings activity, select the action you wish quick tap to perform, and whether you want toast pop-ups to notify you of whether a quick tap was recognised. Once complete, close the activity and navigate to the quick tap settings. There, select QTExtended as the app to open.
